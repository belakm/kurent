# Kurentovanje

### Version **1.01**

Platformer game.

> The Kurent-Korant wears a massive sheepskin garment. Around its waist hangs a chain with huge bells attachedâ€”the resulting noise does a great job of chasing away winter, which is, ostensibly, the Kurent's function. The Korent also wears heavy boots and special red or green leg warmers, while the head is covered by a towering furry hat festooned with ribbons, and a mask typically sporting a long, red tongue. A wooden club is normally carried in the left hand.
